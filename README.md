# Getting Started with Modern Software Development

This project demonstrates some tools and practices used in modern software development. Navigate the different components of this project to see some of these principles in action.

## Source code management
For this demo, we will use the git source code management system (SCM). The tutorial below shows you the basics of git:

This demo is hosted on a GitHub repository, which provides easy-to-use git repositories with extra features for collaboratively working on projects. Navigate [this project](https://github.com/birukw/aait_se_demo) to see a history of commits, branches, and merges.

To start your own project on GitHub, create a github.com account and read the guide:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Once you have created your project, you can invite collaborators to work on it.

## Automated Build System with GNU Make
This project builds with GNU Make. You can get an introduction to GNU Make [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction).

## Issue Tracking
GitHub has a built-in issue tracker to be used for managing feature requests and bugs. Navigate the list of issues in this project and observe their evolution.

## Unit Testing
This demo has a simple, custom unit testing framework. For your own projects, use an existing unit testing framework for your programming language. Examples:
*  [Google's C++ test framework](https://github.com/google/googletest)
*  [Python's unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
*  [The JUnit framework for Java](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)
