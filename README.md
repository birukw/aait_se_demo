# Getting Started with Modern Software Development

This project demonstrates some tools and practices used in modern software development. 

Two "actors", both played by me, have been fake-working on developing a simple modulo calculator :). They used this project to collaborate, utilizing many of the features that GitHub provides. Navigate the different components of this project to see the evolution of their development. 


## Source code management
For this demo, we are using the git source code management system (SCM). The tutorial below shows you the basics of git:
https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1

This demo is hosted on GitHub, which provides easy-to-use git repositories with extra features for collaborating on projects. Navigate [this project](https://github.com/birukw/aait_se_demo) to see a history of commits, branches, and merges.

To start your own project on GitHub, create a github.com account and read the guide:
https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

Once you have created your project, you can invite collaborators to work on it.

## Automated Build System with GNU Make
This project builds with GNU Make. You can get an introduction to GNU Make [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html#Introduction).

## Issue Tracking
GitHub has a built-in issue tracker that are used in this demo for managing feature requests and bugs. Browse [the list of issues](https://github.com/birukw/aait_se_demo/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+) to observe how the two developers collaborated on this project.

## Code Reviews
GitHub has a built in mechanism for code reviews. A developer can request a code review when creating a pull request.

Browse [the list of pull requests](https://github.com/birukw/aait_se_demo/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr) to observe how the two developers used the code review system. 

## Unit Testing
This demo has a simple, custom unit testing framework. For your own projects, use an existing unit testing framework for your programming language. Examples:
*  [Google's C++ test framework](https://github.com/google/googletest)
*  [Python's unit testing framework](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
*  [The JUnit framework for Java](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/)

While browsing the history of issues and pull requests, you can see how unit testing revealed bugs in the code.

## Continuous Integration with TravisCI
This project has been configured to be [built and tested on TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/birukw/aait_se_demo/builds). 

See [this documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/) to get started with TravisCI.
